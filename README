This version is for Spark-1.1.x.

How to use BigDataBench's Spark workloads?

Compile the source code or download a pre-build package(can be found is the `pre-build' folder). For compiling, please refer to: how-to-compile.txt.

Preparations:
Make sure Spark-1.1.x has been successfully installed.
Configure you bash environment:
  $SPARK_HOME points to the path where spark installed;
  Add $SPARK_HOME/bin to the $PATH variable.

The workloads inculde:
  Sort, Grep, Word Count, NaiveBayesTrainer, BayesClassifier, ConnectedComponent, PageRank, KMeans,
  and CF(Collaborate Filtering -- ALS)


How to run:
Assume the .jar file locates in $JAR_FILE.
  Sort
    run:
    spark-submit --class cn.ac.ict.bigdatabench.Sort $JAR_FILE <data_file> <save_file> [<slices>]

    parameters:
    <data_file>: the HDFS path of input data, for example: /test/data.txt
    <save_file>: the HDFS path to save the result
    [<slices>]: optional, times of number of workers

    input data format:
    ordinary text files

    classname text_content

      for example: (class: dog/cat)
      dog Dogs are awesome, cats too. I love my dog
      cat Cats are more preferred by software developers. I never could stand cats. I have a dog
      dog My dog's name is Willy. He likes to play with my wife's cat all day long. I love dogs
      cat Cats are difficult animals, unlike dogs, really annoying, I hate them all

    <model_file>: the HDFS path of Bayes model data(generated with the training program), for example: /test/bayes_model
    <save_file>: the HDFS path to save the classification result
    [<slices>]: optional, times of number of workers

    input data format:
    text_content

      for example:
